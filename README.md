# Bottle Warmer

## A Crockpot hacked to keep bottles warm

This project started one night when I was trying to warm up
some water, so I could make formula, while holding a crying baby.

"Things would be so much easier if the bottles were already up to temperature" I thought.

And then I was buying parts one-handed on Amazon while feeding with the other.

## Project Structure
### [Arduino Sketch](BottleWarmer/BottleWarmer.ino)
### [Python for monitoring and logo generation](BottleLogo)

## Features

* Accurate Temperature control Â±1 degree Fahrenheit
* Programmable Heat cycle to periodically sterilize the water
* Wifi enabled to allow time sync over NTP
    * Also allows for remote monitoring and over the air updates
    * TODO - Add control over http
* OLED Screen to display current temperature
* Rotary encoder to set temperature and cycle time
* EEPROM to maintain settings across power cycles

All in all, this project cost me about $100, and once it's no longer needed
as a bottle warmer, I'll have an accurate
temperature controlled crockpot that functions as a sois vide.
